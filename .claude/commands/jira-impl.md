Begin working on the user specified Atlassian Jira work item by using the Atlassian Jira MCP to retrieve all relevant information.
Before implementation, prepare a detailed plan that breaks down the work item into a sequence of well-defined, ordered actions.
This plan should help ensure a smoother, bug-free development process.
All resulting actions should be created as sub-tasks under the original Jira work item.
